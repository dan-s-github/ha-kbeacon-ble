# Contribution guidelines

Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## GitHub is used for everything

GitHub is used to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've changed something, update the documentation.
3. Make sure your code lints (using `scripts/lint`).
4. Install and run hooks: `uv run --group dev pre-commit install` and `uv run --group dev pre-commit run -a`.
5. Test your contribution.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Commit message linting

This repository enforces Conventional Commits via pre-commit at commit-message time.

Use commit messages in this format:

- `type: short summary`
- `type(scope): short summary`

Examples:

- `feat: add support for connectable advertisements`
- `fix(sensor): ignore invalid temperature payload`
- `chore: bump kbeacon-ble to 1.0.0`

### Releases

Releases are managed with Commitizen and a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow.

- Version source of truth: `project.version` in `pyproject.toml`
- Synced file: `custom_components/kbeacon/manifest.json` `version` field
- Tag format: `vX.Y.Z`

To cut a release, run the `Release` workflow from Actions and choose the increment (`PATCH`, `MINOR`, or `MAJOR`).

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](../../issues)

GitHub issues are used to track public bugs.
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Use Ruff formatting and linting (`scripts/lint` or pre-commit) to keep style consistent.

## Test your code modification

This custom component is based on [integration_blueprint template](https://github.com/ludeeus/integration_blueprint).
For the KBeacon BLE integration repository, see [ha-kbeacon-ble](https://github.com/dan-s-github/ha-kbeacon-ble).

It comes with development environment in a container, easy to launch
if you use Visual Studio Code. With this container you will have a stand alone
Home Assistant instance running and configured for development within the
container environment.

**Note:** The devcontainer will not allow mapping the host Bluetooth adapter on macOS, but it might work on a Linux host. For full Bluetooth testing, you may need to run Home Assistant directly on the host machine or use a physical device.
